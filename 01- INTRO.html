Kubernetes replace the monitoring team who monitor and manage the servers to be up 100% and not to crash 
if the server crashes it create sa copy of it instantly
SWARM , MARATHON , RENCHER are the similar tools as K8S
container cluster launch the server when it goes down 
Replicas is the feature of  K8S . to manage the clients it launch copy of it based on no. of clients

*  Minikube is the installer of  K8S
minikube.exe   download for windows and install 
cd  c:\programfiles\kubernetes\minikube 

minikube.exe start 


=> kubernetes doesnot launch the container it connect to container engine   and ask to launch  ( here its docker )


    kubectl.exe   cluster-info    ---> provides the entire cluster information

if the command doesnot works download the command and paste in the same path where we are runninf from   else setup the path in env to run from anypath

to login into minikube shell

    go to the VM launched in Virtual Box and use the credentials    user -->  docker   password --->  tcuser

by default docker is installed in minikube 

kubernetes add the features to containers  launched by user   
    docker     --- >  image : container
    kubernetes --- >  image : pod

kubectl.exe get pods
kubectl.exe create  deployment myweb --image=httpd
kubectl get pods 
kubectl delete pod myweb
kubectl get pods

-------- here the pod stil exist since we launched deployment and it relaunches the pods when it is lost

-->   to launch multiple similar pods we use replicas  increasing replicas is said to be scale out  and decreasing is scale in 

kubectl.exe  scale deploy myweb  --replicas=5
kubectl get pods

minikube.exe  ip   --> displays IP ( node IP )

kubectl expose deploy myweb --port=80 --type=Nodeport          ---> it exposes our container to public 

kubectl.exe   get service

http://<nodeip>:<port>        ----> we will access to the server

  the server run even deleting the pod  since the pod gets relaunches and the request is allocated to the existing pod within the replicas
