          splunk  --  log management tool

  => whenever we connect to a server through internet  the server creates a log and store it in  a file 

  => Log is a historical record that has the details of the client server conected at an instant  
  => It is not good practice to run multiple  programs in one OS since if the OS gets hacked  all the programs  get effected
  => but to run multiple programs we use a pattern or tool like splunk which creates a agent program to the main server
  => Agent program is a helper Program 
  => To control or manage two or more containers simultaneously we launch them in single pod.
  => The combination of pods in which each pod has multiple containers is called Multi-container Tier  app 


  1.  side car 
        main program  --> log  --> Agent program  ---> splunk  
        log format   --->  the pattern in which log details created 
        ETL  Operation ---  Extract  , Transform  , Load 


  2. Adaptor 
         
        main program  --> log -->  change log format  --> Agent Program  -->  Splunk

3.  Ambassdor

      Main Program  --> Proxie  --> Data Bases  

      Proxie it switches to the particualr database as per the requirement

                                            * User Capabilities 

    Running the container with a Limited user instead root

    CAP_SYS_ADMIN   ---->  is a capability   info in document  

We use Docker run --cap-drop  < power >  -it centos    -----> to disable the capability
