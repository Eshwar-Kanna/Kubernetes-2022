Replication Controller   :   
        kubernetes controller is the one that relaunch when pod deleted


=> apply command is used to recreate after changes in yml file

=> selector is used in RC  such that it select that  particular pod from all existing pods  and monitor it to keep available to clients with mentioned replicas 

=> template is used to mention  the details of pod so that it recreate the pod when is is down with the details in template


3. myrc.yml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata: 
  name: myrc1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    dc: IN
  template:
    metadata:
      name: "mypod"
      labels:
       dc: IN
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: "myrc1"
        image: "httpd"


kubectl create -f myrc.yml

     
minikube ssh    ---->  to login into shell from CLI instaed in VM the shell is called cluster or svc

route -n   -->  Describe the Ip connected with 0.0.0.0   
docker ps    
docker attach   < name / ID >

docker exec -it < pod ID >  sh  ---> shell of pod 
  hostname -i  --> to know IP


  when we expose a pod then it generate new  service in the container and provide a IP  for it to use service and access to it publicly 

  TYPES of SERVICES

    1. Nodeport   2. Clusterip  3. Loadbalancer 

  kubectl get svc 

  svc works as load balancer in K8S   like hAproxy  and Ngnix

  kubectl run myweb --image=vimal13/apache-webserver-php
  kubectl exec -it myweb --bash -->  get bash of above pod 
  kubectl expose pod myweb --type=Nodeport    --port=80
  kubectl delete all --all    ---> deletes everything in the cluster or node
